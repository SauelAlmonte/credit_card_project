# Credit Card Form
This repository contains the code for a simple and responsive credit card form implemented using HTML and CSS.

### HTML Structure
#### Document Type Declaration
The HTML document begins with a declaration specifying the HTML version in use. This ensures that browsers interpret the HTML code correctly.

### Meta Tags
Meta tags provide essential information about the document. They include details such as character encoding, description, subject, copyright, date, and keywords. These tags help search engines and browsers understand the content of the page.

### Viewport Configuration
A viewport meta tag is included to configure the viewport for responsive design. This ensures that the web page adapts well to different device screen sizes.

### Favicon
A favicon is specified for the browser tab. The favicon is a small icon that represents the website and is visible in the browser tab.

### External Resources
Connections to external resources, such as Google Fonts, are preconnected. This optimizes the loading of these resources for better performance.

### Main Content
The main content is wrapped in a container element with the class "content-grid." This section includes two main components:

- Credit Card Previews: These previews include the front and back views of a credit card. The front view displays elements like a background image, card logo, card number, cardholder's name, and expiry date. The back view includes a background image and the Card Verification Code (CVC).

- Form: A form element is present with the class "form." Inside the form, there's a site title. The form may include input fields, buttons, or other elements depending on its intended functionality.

This HTML structure creates a visually appealing and semantically organized credit card form. The provided explanation highlights the purpose and role of each section within the HTML document. Adjustments and customization can be made based on specific project requirements.

# CSS Styles
### Root Variables
CSS root variables are defined for color schemes, font family, font sizes, font weights, and various color values. These variables provide a centralized way to manage and update styles throughout the CSS file.

### Universal Box Sizing
A universal selector sets the box-sizing property to "border-box" for all elements and pseudo-elements. This ensures a consistent box model throughout the project.

### HTML Color Scheme
The color-scheme property is applied to the HTML element to set the color scheme defined in the root variables. This helps in maintaining a consistent color scheme across the document.

### Body Styles
Styles for the body include setting the margin to 0, specifying the font family, size, and line height. These styles provide a baseline for the overall document.

### Container Styles
A class named "container" is defined with styles to limit its width and center it using auto margins. This class is likely used to wrap content and maintain a readable layout.

### Heading Styles
Styles for headings, such as site titles and section titles, are defined. This includes adjustments to font size and line height for improved readability and visual hierarchy.

### Visually Hidden Class
A class named "visually-hidden" is defined with styles to visually hide an element while keeping it accessible to screen readers. This is useful for providing information that is important for accessibility but should not be visible on the screen.

### Form Styles
Styles for the form include a semi-transparent background and centering of content using grid placement. These styles contribute to the visual presentation of the form.

### Content Grid Styles
Styles for the content grid include setting maximum inline size, padding, margin, and display properties. Media queries are used to adjust styles for larger screens, aligning items and managing the grid layout.

### Image Styles
Styles for images ensure responsiveness by setting the maximum width to 100% and making them block-level elements. This ensures that images scale appropriately based on the size of the viewport.

### Card Previews Styles
Styles for card previews include a relative position and top offset. These styles likely contribute to the positioning and spacing of the credit card previews within the layout.

### Card Front and Back Styles
Styles for the front and back of the credit card are defined, specifying absolute positioning and adjusting the position of card elements. These styles contribute to the visual presentation of the credit card views.

### Media Query for Larger Screens
A media query is used to apply styles for larger screens, including adjustments to card previews and layout changes. This ensures a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.

This CSS structure provides a comprehensive and organized set of styles for the credit card form. Each section of the CSS file is explained to give insights into its purpose and contribution to the overall design. Adjustments and customization can be made based on specific project requirements.
